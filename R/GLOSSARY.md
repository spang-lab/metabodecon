- `sdp` = Scaled Data Points.
- `ppm` = Parts per Million. Usually drawn as bottom x-Axis
- `ss` = Signal Strength.
- `sss` = Scaled Signal Strength. Usually draw as left y-Axis.

# Abbreviations

- `sfrl` = Signal Free Region Left Border. Usually draw as green vertical line.
- `sfrr` = Signal Free Region Right Border. Usually draw as green vertical line.
- `ws` = Water Signal.
- `sfx` = Scaling Factor for x-Axis. Used to generate *Scaled Data Points*.
- `sfy` = Scaling Facto for y-Axis. Used to generate *Scaled Signal Strength*
