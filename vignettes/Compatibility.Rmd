The original MetaboDecon1D package (v0.2.2) provided four functions for
deconvoluting spectra and visualizing results. With the introduction of
metabodecon (v1.x), new functions for aligning deconvoluted spectra were added,
along with improved replacements for the deconvolution functions. To maintain
backwards compatibility, the old deconvolution functions are still available but
marked as deprecated. These old functions will be removed entirely in
Metabodecon v2.0.

A tabular overview of function introductions, deprecations, and scheduled
removals is provided in [Table 1: Version Matrix](#table-1-version-matrix).

A similar graphical representation with additional information about accepted
and returned types is provided in
[Figure 1: Metabodecon Workflow](#figure-1-metabodecon-workflow).

- BWC == backwards compatible
- F1 == MetaboDecon1D
- F2 == generate_lorentz_curves
- F3 == deconvolute_ispecs
- The faster peak selection implementation also fixes an indexing bug, which in
  most cases shouldn't have any effect, but in some rare cases might cause
  one peak to be missed.
