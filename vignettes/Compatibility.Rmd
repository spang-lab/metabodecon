The original MetaboDecon1D package provided four functions for deconvoluting spectra and visualizing results. With the introduction of metabdecon, new functions for aligning deconvoluted spectra were added, along with improved replacements for the deconvolution functions. To maintain backwards compatibility, the old deconvolution functions are still available but marked as deprecated. These old functions will be removed entirely in Metabodecon 2.0, planned for 2025.

A tabular overview of function introductions, deprecations, and scheduled removals is provided in [Table 1: Version Matrix](#table-1-version-matrix).

A similar graphical representation with additional information about accepted and returned types is provided in [Figure 1: Metabodecon Workflow](#figure-1-metabodecon-workflow).

- ᵃ BWC == backwards compatible
- ᵇ F1 ==MetaboDecon1D, F2 == generate_lorentz_curves, F3 == deconvolute_ispecs
- ᶜ The change is backwards compatible if you ignore global state, such as files written to disk or output printed to STDOUT. However, if a script expects such side effects, it will fail. Therefore we set this to "semi".
- ᵈ The faster implementation also fixes an indexing bug, which in most cases shouldn't have any effect, but in some rare cases it might cause one peak to be missed.
- ᵉ Only true for MetaboDecon1D versions >= v1.0.0
