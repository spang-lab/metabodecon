# FAQ

## Water Artifact

__Question:__ When I choose `n` for `Water artefact fully inside red vertical lines? (y/n)`, metabodecon asks me to `Choose another half width range (in ppm) for the water artefact`, instead of left and right borders. Why is that and what should I enter here?

<img src="./FAQ/water_artefact_n.png" alt="Water Artefact">

__Answer:__ the water signal is always centered by Bruker, so you only have to specify the half width range to make the water area around the midpoint wider or narrower.

## Parameter Optimization

__Question:__ Why do you do exactly 10 iterations of parameter optimization?

__Answer:__ This value was determined empirically. We found that 10 iterations are enough to get a good fit and more iterations would not improve the fit significantly, but would take longer. Obviously, a more objective stopping criterion would be better and will likely be implemented in a future version.

## File Structure

__Question:__ What file structure is expected for `bruker` and `jcampdx` formats?

__Answer:__ The expected file structure is as follows:

```txt
C:/bruker/urine              # data_path (user input)
├── urine_1/                 # name (user input)
│   └── 10/                  # spectroscopy_value (user input), called expno in TopSpin manual
│       ├── acqus            # acqus_file (constant)
│       └── pdata/           # processings_dir (constant)
│           └── 10/          # processing_value (user input), called procno in TopSpin manual
│               ├── 1r       # spec_file (constant)
