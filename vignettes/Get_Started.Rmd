This article shows how Metabodecon can be used for  deconvoluting  and  aligning
one-dimensional NMR spectra using the pre-installed [Sim] dataset as an example.
The Sim dataset includes 16  simulated  spectra,  each  with  2048  data  points
ranging from â‰ˆ 3.6 to  3.3  ppm.  These  simulated  spectra  closely  mimic  the
resolution and signal strength of real NMR experiments on blood plasma  from  16
individuals. The Sim dataset is used instead of the Blood dataset because it  is
smaller, faster to process, and comes pre-installed with the package.  For  more
information on the Sim and Blood datasets, see [Datasets].

# Deconvolute spectra

To find the path to the  Sim  dataset,  you  can  use  the  `metabodecon_file()`
function, which returns the path to any file or  directory  within  the  package
directory. To deconvolute the  spectra  within  the  Sim  dataset  you  can  use
`generate_lorentz_curves()`:

```R
sim_dir <- metabodecon::metabodecon_file("bruker/sim")
deconvoluted_spectra <- metabodecon::generate_lorentz_curves(
    data_path = sim_dir, # Path to directory containing spectra
    sfr = c(3.35, 3.55), # Borders of signal free region (SFR) in ppm
    wshw = 0,            # Half width of water signal (WS) in ppm
    smopts = c(2, 5),    # Configure smoothing parameters
    verbose = FALSE      # Suppress status messages
)
```

After calling `generate_lorentz_curves()`, the function will ask you  to  answer
the following questions to determine the optimal deconvolution parameters:

1. Use same parameters for all spectra? (y/n)
2. Number of spectrum for adjusting parameters? (1: sim_01, 2: sim_02, ...)
3. Signal free region correctly selected? (y/n)
4. Water artefact fully inside red vertical lines? (y/n)

You can answer questions one and two  with  `y`  and  `1`,  as  the  dataset  is
homogeneous, i.e., all spectra were measured in  the  same  lab  with  the  same
acquisition and processing parameters. However, for heterogeneous datasets, it's
advisable to optimize parameters for each batch of spectra individually.

Questions three and  four  are  accompanied  by  two  plots,  shown  in  [Figure
1](#fig-sim01-sfr-and-wsr), which  help  you  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the
selected signal-free region (SFR) and water signal half-width (WSHW) [^wshw]. In
this case, the provided parameters are already fine,  so  you  can  answer  both
questions with `y`. If adjustments are needed, you  can  respond  with  `n`  and
input the correct values.

<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
The first spectrum of the Sim dataset. The x-Axis gives the  chemical  shift  of
each datapoint in parts per million (ppm). The y-Axis gives the signal intensity
of each datapoint in arbitrary units (au). The borders of the signal free region
are shown as green vertical lines in the left plot.  The  center  of  the  water
signal is shown as a red vertical line in the  right  plot.  Because  the  water
signal half width is set to zero, the borders of the water signal  region  equal
its center.

When using the function in scripts, where interactive user input is not desired,
you can disable the interactive prompting by setting parameter `ask` to `FALSE`.
In this case, the provided parameters will be used for the deconvolution of all
spectra automatically. [^askFALSE]

# Visualize deconvoluted spectra

After completing the deconvolution, it is advisable to visualize the extracted
signals using `plot_spectrum()` to assess the quality of the deconvolution:

```R
# Visualize the first spectrum only
metabodecon::plot_spectrum(deconvoluted_spectra[[1]])

# Visualize all spectra and save them to a pdf file
pdfpath <- tempfile(fileext = ".pdf")
pdf(pdfpath, width = 12, height = 8)
for (i in seq_along(deconvoluted_spectra)) {
    metabodecon::plot_spectrum(
        x = deconvoluted_spectra[[i]],
        main = deconvoluted_spectra[[i]]$filename,
        foc_frac = c(0.25, 0.75)
    )
}
dev.off()
cat("Plots saved to", pdfpath, "\n")
```

Out of the 16 generated plots, the first two are shown as  examples  in  [Figure
2](#fig-sim1-plots). Things to look out for are:

1. That the smoothing does not remove any real signals. If the smoothing is  too
   strong, i.e., the smoothed signal intensity (SI) is very different  from  the
   raw SI, you should adjust the smoothing parameters `smopts` in  the  call  to
   `generate_lorentz_curves()`.
2. That   the superposition of the lorentz curves is a good approximation of the
   smoothed SI. If major peaks are missed by the algorithm,  you  should  reduce
   the threshold `delta` in the call to `generate_lorentz_curves()`.

<strong>Figure 2.</strong>
Deconvolution results for the first two spectra of the Sim dataset. The  raw  SI
(black), smoothed SI (blue), and  superposition  of  Lorentz  curves  (red)  are
closely aligned, indicating that <code>smopts</code> and <code>delta</code> were
chosen well and that the deconvolution was successful.

# Align deconvoluted spectra

The last step in the Metabodecon Workflow is to align the deconvoluted  spectra.
This is necessary because the chemical shifts of the peaks in  the  spectra  may
vary slightly due to differences in the measurement conditions.

To  visualize  the  data  before  and  after  the   alignment,   you   can   use
`plot_spectra()`. To do the alignment, you can use `align()`:

```R
metabodecon::plot_spectra(deconvoluted_spectra)
aligned_spectra <- metabodecon::align(deconvoluted_spectra, maxCombine = 1)
metabodecon::plot_spectra(aligned_spectra)
```

The resulting plots are shown in [Figure 3](#fig-sim-spectra-overlayed)

<strong>Figure 3.</strong>
Overlay of all 16 deconvoluted spectra from the Sim dataset.  The  x-Axis  gives
the chemical shift of each datapoint in parts  per  million  (ppm).  The  y-Axis
gives the signal intensity of each datapoint in arbitrary units (au). All specta
are pretty similar to each other except for  Spetrum  2,  which  appears  to  be
shifted approx. 0.01 ppm to the right.

<!-- Footnotes -->

[^wshw]: Since the used dataset was simulated based on  actual  measurements  in
    the  range  of  approx.  3.6  to  3.3  ppm,  it   doesn't  contain  a  water
    signal. Therefore, the water signal half width was set to zero.

[^askFALSE]: In this case it may be useful to set `ask = TRUE` for the first run
    to determine the optimal parameters interactively and then set `ask = FALSE`
    for subsequent runs.
