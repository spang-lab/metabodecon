* `blood`: Sixteen 1D CPMG NMR spectra of blood plasma in Bruker format
* `urine`: Two NOESY NMR spectra of urine.
* `test`: Same as Blood dataset. Renamed to `blood` in 2023/12/04 to improve docs ("blood" is more consistent with "urine" and avoids confusion with test-datasets and internal test files for the package). The old folder is kept around for backwards compatibility (because some people might use the old vignette that downloads and refers to test).
