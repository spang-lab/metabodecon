* `blood`: Sixteen 1D CPMG NMR spectra of blood plasma in Bruker format
* `urine`: Two NOESY NMR spectra of urine.
* `test`: Same as Blood dataset. But renamed to `blood` in 2023/12/04 to improve docs ("blood" is more consistent with "urine" and avoids confusion with test-datasets and internal test files for the package).
