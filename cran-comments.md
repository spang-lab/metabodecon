## Resubmission

Both notes are about the suggested dependency 'mdrb', which is
available on https://spang-lab.r-universe.dev. This dependency
contains optional rust code to make some functions of the package
faster and is maintained by our group as well (Spang Lab, Uni
Regensburg). The repository https://spang-lab.r-universe.dev is
listed as 'Additional Repository' in the DESCRIPTION file.
